Get My Mangos
=============

Python script that updates your library with the latest chapters of your favourite mangas.  
**Currently only works for MangaReader and MangaPanda links**  
**Written with Python 2.7.9. Will probably update to Python 3**

### Adding your manga
1. Copy URL of manga's base location, e.g. http://www.mangareader.net/psyren
2. Paste links on separate lines in the `config.txt` file below the dashed line
3. [Optional] Change default library directory within quotes

### Running script
1. Must have [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
2. Install `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries (locally or globally)
3. Run `python mango.py`
4. View with your preferred comic/manga-reading [software](http://lifehacker.com/5858906/five-best-desktop-comic-book-readers)

More manga sources in the works.
And no there's no typo in the title :)
